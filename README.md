# Practicals

## Folder: Prac1&2

### Practical 1 - Agent based modelling
### Practical 2 - Code Shrinking I

Within this folder is the code I used for the first practical - Agent based modelling. The purpose of this practical was to introduce us to the concept of an agent based model, and begin to programme the model itself using Python. Within this practical are examples of **if** statements and use of the **random** package.

Lastly we used pythagorus' theorem to calculate a distance between two randomly located agents.



## Folder: Prac 3

### Practical 3 - Code Shrinking II

In this practical I used **for** loops to clear any unneccesary repetition and shorten the code. This practical also saw the use of the remainder(_**%**_) tool, which allowed the agents to stay within the plot area.



## Folder: Prac 4

### Practical 4 - Building Tools

This practical involved defining functions, in this case to calculate a distance between sheep. Through use of this I was able to provide a distance between each sheep, using the following code to prevent repetition:

```python
for j in range (i+1 ,num_of_agents): #i+1 so it does not count itself
```


## Folder: Prac 5&6

### Practical 5 - Agents!
### Practical 6 - I/O

In these practicals I was able to define functions for the sheep eating, moving and sharing an initialised environment with one another. The environment was initialised using a **.csv reader**, which was then available for the taking (or eating) by our sheep agent.
